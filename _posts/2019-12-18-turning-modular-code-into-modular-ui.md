This article is the third in a series about content management systems from the lens of UX design. We'll take a closer look at component driven software development method and apply it to the way we build administrative user interfaces.

Atomic design patterns. BEM methodology. SMACCS framework. OOPCSS. OOP-anything. These aren't just random (abbreviations). They are all methodologies for modular (or component-driven) software development.

# What does component-driven really mean?
- examples of each with pics ;)
- modules in Drupal
- Classes and inheritance
- Not just for backend programming languages (PHP, Java, etc.) but also frontend: Atomic, BEM, SMACCS are a few I've used.

# How can I implement component-driven design in my CMS?
1. Layouts based on components (see related case study Noble Systems)
1. provide a living styleguide with code snippets. Wordpress calls these _shortcodes_.
	- Make your development faster(?) by building out your own pattern-driven user interface using Pattern Lab. (see related article on pattern lab)
1. WYSIWYG should include components (layouts, buttons)
