Talking to a friend, walking through how to use a MacBook Pro. Get a file from Onedrive to Dropbox. I could hear the frustration in her voice. "This is something I would do everyday. I know how to do this on my machine at work. Claire, I'm good at what I do."

Those were the words that grabbed my heartstrings. I pictured myself years ago, at the brink of tears, late night by myself in an office. Having developers look at me and say "Is that what you were doing all this time?" "It's so easy." "Take a deep breath. You are smart. You are excellent at what you do. This is just something knew. Once you've learned it, you'll be fine."

Something I've seen over and over. You know _what_ to do but not _how_. I've had good and bad experiences. I once had a manager rail into me because I couldn't move a document from one directory to another via command line. Granted, for him that was the easiest way to move the file. But for me, there would have been nothing wrong with opening Finder, drag and drop. Instead I caved under his glare and felt ashamed. As if I were dumb and incapable of learning. And then I learned. And I never forgot.

There are lots of ways to skin a cat. As long as you get the end result. So I learned a trick from then on. If I'm frustrated with they _how_, I'll ask for specific on the _what_. In an authoritative tone, "What's the endgoal here? What do you want me to do?" Usually, I know _a_ how, just not _his_ how. So I verbally express the method I'm aware of. It confirms that I'm intelligent, not for his sake, but for my own. If he's cool, he'll show me another method which adds to my skills. If he's a jerk, I'll google it. But at least I know what to look for.

Here are some tips:

1. Take a deep breath. Go for a walk if necessary.
1. Affirm that you're good at what you do. Recall a recent accomplishment or something you learned that you're proud.
1. Put things in perspective. What's the worst that will happen if you don't get it right this second?
1. Ask someone. It's important to do this step last. You've got to be calm before you reach out for help. Tell them what you're trying to do  - your objective. Then state the approach you've already tried - your solution. This is important. You gotta strike a balance between throwing up your hands without bothering to try and trying so many approaches that hours have passed and you still haven't found a solution.

Here are some reasons a fellow developer may not want to help you:
1. They've told you the same answer multiple times, which you keep forgetting.
1. They're on a tight deadline on another project.
1. They just got chewed out by their project manager about missing their deadline.
1. They're a jerk.

Other than the above situations, your fellow devs are there to help. Some even enjoy a small distraction to take their mind off their current project.

In the end, my friend mentioned at the outset, quickly learned how to navigate her new Mac.
