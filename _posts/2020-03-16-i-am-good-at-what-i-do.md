Talking to a friend over Zoom, as most of us are doing during this COVID-19 quarantine, I found myself faced with a deep fear I thought I’d left in the past. The fear of the _how_.

My friend recently received a MacBook Pro. She has used Windows-based machines her entire professional life. Excited about her graduation to a superior quality environment (queue jeers from Microsoft lovers), I walked her through the basics of a Mac.

We ran through the usual...no need to double-click icons, what is Finder, installing software by dragging and dropping, etc. Then came a more challenging task: get a file from Onedrive and move it to Dropbox. What started as a fun walk through quickly turned into panic. “Why can’t I see my files? Why can’t I drag? My mouse isn’t scrolling!” I could hear the frustration in her voice. "This is something I would do every day on my machine at work. Claire, **I'm good at what I do.**"

Those words that tugged at my heartstrings. I winced. I pictured myself fifteen years ago, on the brink of tears, another late-night by myself in an office. I knew the data I needed to be returned from the database, but I had no idea how to write this in a Drupal hook. Why wasn’t it working? This code has to be ready by tomorrow morning. I could hear my boss saying to me, “This is the solution you came up with? What were you doing all this time? It's so easy." Back to me, trying to convince him and myself that I'm not an idiot. **I'm good at what I do.**

I snapped out of my flashback. I said to my friend calmly, "Listen to me. You are smart. You are excellent at what you do. This is just something new. Once you've learned it, you will be fine. Now, let’s try this again."

It was like I was talking to my younger self. It’s something I’ve had to tell myself over and over in my career. **I'm good at what I do. This is just something new. Once you've learned it, you will be fine.**

> This is just something new. Once you've learned it, you will be fine.

Unfortunately, deadlines make us forget that we _need_ to learn. We are less forgiving with ourselves when we’re pushed to deliver and pressed for time. But we can’t possibly know everything. We have to give ourselves time to learn.

## Knowing _what_ to do, but not knowing _how_

I've had good and bad experiences when it comes to learning. Especially as a freelancer, I'm continually thrown into new environments, new software, new systems and expected to deliver top quality &mdash; quickly. The client asks for a feature. I have absolutely no idea how to do it. But I give an estimate and get to work...research, code, test, repeat. The longer I work in software development, the more I understand the _what_; it’s the _how_ that changes constantly.

Very early in my career, I had a manager rail into me because I didn’t know how to move a document from one directory to another via the command line. Granted, for him, using the command line was the easiest way to move a file. For me, there was nothing wrong with opening Finder, dragging the file and dropping it to its new location. I knew _what_ to do. However, I caved under his condescending glare and felt ashamed. I didn’t know _how_ to do it his way. At that moment, I felt so dumb and incapable of learning anything.

And then he walked away. And I learned. And I never forgot.

And then I became a command-line rockstar.

> If I had a week to learn this, would I be so frustrated? No.

Now, when I’m dealing with a developer that expects me to know _their how_, I'll ask for specifics on the _what_. I ask in an authoritative tone, "So, what's the end-goal here? What are we trying to accomplish?" Then I state the method I’m familiar with. It reaffirms that I'm an intelligent and capable developer; not for their sake, but for my own. **I'm good at what I do**. If the developer has another approach, I pay close attention to this new method, which adds to my skillset. **This is just something new. Once you've learned it, you will be fine.**

Here are some tips to remember the next time you are frustrated having to learn something new, quickly:

1. **Take a deep breath.** Go for a walk if necessary.
1. **Affirm that you are good at what you do.** Recall a recent accomplishment or something you learned that you're proud of.
1. **Put things in perspective.** What's the worst that will happen if I don't get it right this second? If I had a week to learn this, would I be so frustrated? No. So I’m not an idiot. I only have two hours. I’m going to do the best I can for someone compelled to learn this in two hours.
1. **Try.** You must strike a balance between not bothering to try and wasting time trying too many solutions. And if you find one that works, commit and move on. Remember, you can always refactor the _how_ later.
1. **Ask for help.** As freelancers, we're hired for our expertise. But it is impossible to know everything. Express clearly what you're trying to do, state the approach you've already tried, and be open to a different solution. Even if the developer you ask is a jerk about it, you've learned something new to add to your skillset. **Once you've learned it, you will be fine.**

By the way, my friend mentioned at the outset quickly learned how to navigate her new Mac. It’s been two weeks, and she’s moving just as fast on her home Mac as she would on her work machine. Now, if I can just convince her to never go back to Windows again.
