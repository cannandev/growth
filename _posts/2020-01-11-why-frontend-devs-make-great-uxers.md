As frontend developers we do a lot of UX research without labeling as such...

interviewing visual designers to understand what he had in mind when he created this mock, interview clients/stakeholders to understand what problem they’re trying to solve, usability test content management admins to see what they’re expecting once they click the update button. Read and understand sitemaps, user flows and wireframes. Request A/B tests and SEO results to understand which browsers versions and mobile devices we need to build for/test. Review quality assurance tests and see where we can improve accessibility and the user interface. Interview backend developers to see what data is available to frontend and how to access it. Most of these conversations on slack and emails.
