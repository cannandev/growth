As frontend developers, we do a lot of UX research without even knowing it. Here are some skills that help make a good transition.

## Interviewing
* Interview visual designers to understand interactions and expected behavior
* Interview clients and users to understand what problem theyâ€™re trying to solve
* Interview backend developers to see what data is available to frontend and how to access it.

## Prototyping
* Research features and build prototypes to estimate how long it will take to code

## Usability Testing
* Frontend developers can conduct usability tests with users in development or sandbox environments. The results are quick feedback and faster code iterations.
* Request A/B tests and SEO results to understand which browsers and mobile devices are used.
* Review quality assurance test results to improve code and accessibility.

Most of these conversations occur on Slack and emails instead of controlled UX labs. Nevertheless, the information gained is vital to creating a user-centered product.

Include product developers as early as possible in the design thinking process. Make sure frontend developers have time to review wireframes long before they start to write code. They can provide insight into tasks often overlooked when forecasting design sprints.
