This article is the second in a series about content management systems from the lens of user experience design. After all, content managers are users too!

It's almost 2020 and it looks like we're finally headed in the right direction. I'm talking about *user-centered design*. This phrase is included in job descriptions, design reviews, product presentations. More businesses are realizing that their ROI is greater afer they've spend time finding out their user's behavior rather than buying a ton of SEO keywords.

By user behavior, I don't mean tracking clicks and purchase history. I mean user interaction with the product.

That said,


1. Include content managers in user research
	- Create content manager user persona.
	- Participate in interviews, surveys, user testing.
1. Don't force them to learn code.
	- Modular code -> modular interface (separate article)
	- Quote Scott Abel in *The Language of Content Strategy*
		> "The stuff inside a container...content is between a set of standardized markup tags, allowing technology to automate the processing of content."
		- so don't make your content managers have to add markup tags. You provide the tags, let them provide the "stuff inside"
		- predefined buttons
		- use markdown
		- choose your WYSIWYG carefully
	- color pickers or dropdown list of colors from a preselected palette (color blind)
	- choose from gallery of images instead of an input field for file name
1. Make your interface accessible
	- tools
	- Drupal allows you to use the current theme as administrative theme
1. Make your interface flexible.
	- What if this title is 3 lines instead of the 1 shown in the mockup?
	- What if there are
1. Think about the future.
	- One year from now, will a new intern know how to upload this file?
