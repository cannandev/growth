## Background
 With the increasing influence of the internet and social media, the role of a brand ambassador has evolved, and there are now even more opportunities for those looking to make some extra cash representing a brand they love. A company chooses a brand ambassador to be the "face" of the brand. Ideally, the candidate is a tastemaker in their communities, and should plan to use already established networks and relationships to market the brand via word-of-mouth marketing tactics (i.e. referring friends, posting about the brand online, etc.). On top of that, a brand ambassador will also represent her company at specific events, where she may perform product demonstrations or give away sample products.

## What I did
Built a clickable mobile app prototype for mintcreativeco.com, a pet photography/design studio with 1200 social media followers. Conducted audience and competitor research to develop business requirements and user personas. Used draw.io and Balsamiq to create a content sitemap, user flows and wireframes. Focused on providing an easy and fun interface that matched the company brand.
