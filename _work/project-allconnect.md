Allconnect wanted to rebrand their website using UX methods. It was also an opportunity to upgrade their content management software for their "behind the scenes users" &mdash; the content administrators.

## Problem Statement
Success of allconnect.com was high ranking in SEO. **Need a safe and easy way of rendering SEO content**. Content managers should not need to know HTML or CSS or JavaScript. SEO/SEO managers needed an easier way to update content and keywords. A good CMS lets users be good at their job, not force to learn another.

## Users & Audience
The UX Director and UX Architect focused on the customers visiting the site; mainly movers in need of home services in their new home. As the software architect, I focused on the content managers, the "behind the scenes" users of the content managment system. This included two SEO managers, an SEM expert, and the entire marketing team.

## Roles & Responsibilities
As the Senior Web Developer & Drupal Architect, my goal was to make the administrative interface easy to use without knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript. Learned UX methods from the Director and Architect. First time in a UX team took lead in Product Team. I worked closely with these two women, titans in technology.

Build and maintain functional web applications as a part of the first company User Experience Digital Team. Prioritized software development projects, setting timelines, identifying deliverables and assigning tasks to team members.

Worked closely with the UX Architect and Visual Designer to implement new features onto allconnect.com as a result of testing. Looped into observing customer behavior during usability tests on usertesting.com, interviews, surveys and card sorts. Participated in paper prototype usability tests for content managers. Conducted interviews with content managers.

## Scope & Constraints
Year...number of months. Agile project. Daily scrum calls with development team. Easy to convince stakeholders (CEO, Marketing Director, Engineering Director)  how understanding our customers' behvior could lead to more site conversion. Needed to convince the stakeholders that why we needed to make major changes to the backend - the content management system behind the site. This was more than just a "facelift".
Showed 1) time wasted and frustration of admins trying to enter content 2) site vulnerabilities.

## Process

### Empathize

Through in person (name for this) **interviews, usability tests and paper prototypes**, determined the following pain-points:
**Pain point 1) Difficult to update content.** Watched content admins copy and paste code into a giant body field. Observed them wading through a sea of code. One mispelled variable, one missing semi-colon - boom the whole page failed to render.
Not to mention the security risk.

**Pain Point 2) Difficult to find content.** As if updating content on a page was not painful enough, finding that content again was another nightmare.

**Pain Point 3) Security Risk.** Lorem ipsum.

### Research
UX architect used persona, research to develop sketches for frontend.

### Design
Using new designs, sketched components, content types and fields to build in the new CMS.

### Implement
Build components in Drupal to match.

### Test & Repeat
Worked with audience members to test. An iterative process to make changes.

## Results & Lessons Learned
Content managers happy. Improved overall site conversion by 10% with 4x more online orders. Increased total customers by 27% and gross revenue by 40%. Learned user research methodologies such as A/B Tests with Google Optimize and Adobe Target.

Months later, company bought out. New stakeholders and a new focus. Drupal no longer a viable option for the type of marketing. I’ve moved on but to date one of the projects I’m most proud of. Listened to and watched the user and built a great product with them at the center - both the site visitors and the “behind the scenes” users.
