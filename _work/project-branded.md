How can Drupal help content managers spin up marketing pages quickly? See what happens...

## The Challenge

Innovate a direct marketing platform of partner sites. Allow SEO and SEM managers to spin up marketing pages quickly, preloaded with product information.

## The Work

Architected a Drupal 7 multisite with custom install profiles, modules, content types and field groups.

Designed an administrative interface allowing content managers to quickly spin up marketing pages preloaded with partner branding, products and descriptive fields. Followed UX principles to design the admin interface. Reduced code change requests by converting template markup into safe CMS options.

## Results
Improved overall site conversion by 10% with 4x more online orders. Increased total customers by 27% and gross revenue by 40%. Reduced site build time from 2 weeks to 8 hours.
