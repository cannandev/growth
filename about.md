<h1 class="title">A little about me.</h1>
<p class="text">I help companies implement UX and web development best practices that drive business results. Challenging the status-quo to keep the user's successful journey at the center of all decisions.
</p>
<p class="text">
  A <i>“What’s around the corner?”</i> problem solver and dedicated senior developer with a proven track record of building and cultivating business-critical relationships. Meeting challenges with smart data solutions that put the user first is a top
  priority of mine. Whether the user is a content manager or a customer, I help product managers and designers present data in a way that is easily accessible and user friendly. I am effective and knowledgeable in working with cultures worldwide gained
  from years of international travel and <a href="http://www.jw.org">volunteering</a>. I am fluent in Portuguese - spoken, read and written.</p>
<blockquote>“Whether a content manager or a customer, the user should see data presented in a way that is pleasing and accessible. I can help with that.”

<p class="text">Product managers, software developers, designers and PMs - everyone is a stakeholder in a web project. It is often difficult to communicate with one another, much less express user experience to each group. I can help with that. With twenty years of experience
  in information technology, I've had a part in all facets of the software development life cycle.</p>
<p class="text">Let me help you communicate and advocate user needs between product, business, and technology leaders. I can articulate UX Research findings and UX design decisions to frontend and backend developers. Working from concept to prototype allows me to work
  closely with Quality Assurance testers, ensuring an accessible, usable and performant product.
