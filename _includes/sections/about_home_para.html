        <p>I'm a UX/UI consultant specializing in <strong>user research</strong> and <strong>experience design</strong>. I have a strong background in software development. My top UX skills are interviewing, usability testing, wireframes, prototypes and
          design systems. I love helping others, removing technical obstacles that stand in their way. I get excited about open source technology, especially content management systems used to give back to the community. In my next role, I would like
          to work with a distributed team that builds genuinely <strong>user-centered</strong> applications.</p>
