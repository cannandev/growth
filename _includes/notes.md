#Notes
* Hire expertise, not just ability (Diamond Quote)
* $400 for a onepager
* Free consultation for an assessment
* No less than 4 hours per touchpoint
* Template to score 1-10; Infographic to walk through touchpoints
* Successful businesses and entrepreneurs have to evolve with society. PM, technology evolve. I'm moving into a space that's growing. Development is $5 or free templatized websites (Wix, Squarespace, etc.) Small businesses don't need to hire these skilled. I appreciate these trends...but no one has the expertise. The people painting the vision of where we're going!!!!
The search for the unicorn. Jack of all trades. Master of none.
